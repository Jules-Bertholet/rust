A binding shadowed something it shouldn't.

A match arm or a variable has a name that is already used by
something else, e.g.

* struct name
* enum variant
* static
* associated constant

This error may also happen when an enum variant *with fields* is used
in a pattern, but without its fields.

```compile_fail,E0530
enum Enum {
    WithField(i32)
}

use Enum::*;
match WithField(1) {
    WithField => {} // error: missing (_)
}
```
